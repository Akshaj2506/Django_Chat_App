## Testing WebSocket Connections

1. Open the application in two browsers or two tabs(One of them should be incognito).
2. Create two different users using Signup functionality.
3. Once being authenticated, click on the respective users to open the chat.

## Common Issues
1. **User Responsiveness:** The appearance of mobile layout can be better
2. **WebSocket Errors:** Make sure your browser supports WebSockets and youâ€™re using the correct URL format (`ws://` for local environments, `wss://` for production with HTTPS).
